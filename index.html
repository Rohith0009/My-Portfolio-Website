<p> My hobby is Coding and programming in my free time. Whenever I get free time, I turn on my computer and think what apps I can make Then I Open the coding platform and start coding. When I am bored, I start making YouTube videos on coding. I learned coding when I was 10-year-old. I know some coding languages as html, java script, CSS, I use some platforms like brackets, CodePen and Thunkable. </p>
